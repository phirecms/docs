Introduction
------------

What is Phire CMS? Phire CMS is much more than just another CMS. In reality, it is a
web application framework built using the `Pop PHP Framework`_. It provides a fast and
lightweight modular eco-system in which you can rapidly build and write web-based
applications. At the very core of Phire is only the following components:

- Users
- Roles
- Modules

They allow for the basis of the eco-system to function, from users logging in, to setting
users permissions, to registering modules to extend the application.

Of course, with content management systems being one of the most common web applications
out there these days, the main use-case that is available for download is using Phire as
a full-featured CMS. This is achieved by using a series of pre-written modules that can
be installed to extend the base functionality of Phire.
